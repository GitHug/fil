# Contributing to Fil - Microbial File Storage
This is a hobby project of mine that I have spent quite a lot of time on, mainly just pouring through AWS documentation. It was a chance for me to learn more about Serverless and configuration as code, and I hope the documentation provided can be useful for someone else. Contributions are always welcome however, where it's

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer


## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. Pull requests are welcome!

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs or added new features, update the documentation. This repository is designed for learning so be as detailed as possible and update/add the relevant sections in `README` and `ARCHITECTURE`.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request ðŸš€

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.
